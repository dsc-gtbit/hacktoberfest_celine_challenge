# hacktoberfest_celine_challenge by @bloodstain5201

Using HTML, CSS, and JS, my buddy Celine, who is new to web programming, created a respectable website.
However, she faced some problems after she deployed it locally using Live Server VS Code extension. Your job is to complete the following tasks: 

1) Why the website is not showing up properly.
2) After you're done with making the website running, create a HAMBURGER for the navbar.

Happy Coding!
